## Project Overview • :page_facing_up:

### Overview

**Prediqs** is a decentralized prediction market built on **Polkadot**. The platform allows users to create, trade, and participate in predictions across a wide range of topics, such as sports, politics, finance, and entertainment. By leveraging Polkadot's interoperability and scalability, Prediqs ensures efficient, secure, and low-cost interactions for users, creating a seamless experience.

Key features include:

- **User-Generated Predictions:** Users can create and manage their own prediction markets with customizable rules and parameters.
- **Decentralization:** Operates transparently on Polkadot, ensuring security and trust through distributed ledger technology.
- **Token Rewards:** PRD tokens reward users for successful predictions and incentivize participation. Smart contracts ensure fair token distribution.

**Polkadot's** tech stack enables efficient development, while its interoperability allows Prediqs to connect seamlessly with other parachains and dApps in the Polkadot ecosystem.

   - Validates market details to ensure compliance with platform rules and prevent fraudulent activities.

2. **Participation and Staking Module:**
   - Manages user participation, including token staking for predictions.
   - Ensures accurate tracking of staked amounts and user balances.

3. **Reward Distribution Module:**
   - Calculates and distributes rewards based on prediction outcomes.
   - Implements automated token transfers using on-chain validation mechanisms.
   - Ensures that reward distribution is tamper-proof and transparent.

4. **Fraud Detection and Security:**
   - Includes reentrancy attack prevention measures by utilizing checks-effects-interactions patterns.
   - Implements time locks for critical functions to reduce the risk of exploitation.
   - Provides real-time monitoring and auditing tools for contract performance.

## Main Features

### User-Generated Content

The platform enables users to contribute their own prediction markets, topics, and resolution mechanisms. By incorporating user-generated content, Prediqs empowers the community to:

- Create custom market categories tailored to specific interests.
- Define unique resolution rules for niche prediction scenarios.
- Participate actively in shaping the content available on the platform.

This feature enhances engagement and broadens the scope of prediction markets by allowing users to contribute their expertise and creativity.

### AI-Based Market Resolution

Prediqs integrates advanced AI algorithms to assist in market resolution by:

- Analyzing large datasets in real time to predict outcomes more accurately.
- Offering AI generated insights to improve decision-making for participants.
- Reducing bias in market outcomes by leveraging impartial AI based resolutions.

The AI systems will continuously learn and adapt, ensuring that predictions and resolutions are based on the most reliable data.

### Oracle Integration

To ensure the accuracy and reliability of external data, Prediqs utilizes oracle services, which:

- Fetch real-world data to resolve prediction markets (e.g., election results, sports scores).
- Provide tamper-proof and decentralized verification of external events.
- Enable seamless interaction between on-chain prediction markets and off-chain data sources.

Oracles enhance trust and transparency, ensuring that market outcomes are determined fairly and securely.

### Infinite Scrolling UI

The platform’s UI has been upgraded to include an **infinite scrolling feature**, which:

- Provides a seamless browsing experience for users by loading new markets dynamically as they scroll.
- Reduces page load times and improves performance by fetching content incrementally.
- Enhances user engagement and exploration by presenting content continuously.

This feature creates a modern, intuitive interface that encourages users to explore more markets without interruptions.

## Ecosystem Fit

### Problem Statement

Prediction markets are often centralized, costly, and limited in scope. Prediqs addresses these issues by offering a decentralized, user-driven platform built on Polkadot’s robust infrastructure.

### Target Audience

- DApp developers.
- Prediction enthusiasts.
- Community-driven organizations.
- General users seeking an intuitive and cost-effective prediction platform.

### Evidence of Need

Surveys and market analyses highlight the growing interest in decentralized prediction markets. The current centralized models face scalability issues and lack transparency, making Prediqs’ decentralized approach a significant improvement.

### What Makes Prediqs Different From Other Prediction Markets? 

Unlike existing platforms, Prediqs emphasizes **user-generated markets** and Polkadot’s cross-chain capabilities. These ensure scalability and broader integration possibilities compared to siloed platforms.
